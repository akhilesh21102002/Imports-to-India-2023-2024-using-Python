# India Imports Analysis (2023–2024)

This project analyzes India’s import data for 2023–2024 to compare contributions from ASEAN and Non-ASEAN countries.

The analysis shows ASEAN countries are increasing their share, but China remains a dominant import partner. A Sankey diagram visualizes the flow of imports from India’s top 15 trading partners. Data analysis and visualizations were done using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly.
